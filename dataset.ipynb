Measles vaccine was documented in 20 cases; in 10 measles was also documented and it could not be positively excluded in the remainder. The calculated risk of SSPE following measles was 4.0/100,000 cases compared with the risk after vaccine of 0.14/100,000 doses. Measles under 1 year carried a risk 16 times greater than measles over 5 years. There was an excess of cases in third and subsequent children. The incidence was higher in the northwest than in the southeast of the country. Survival time varied from 4 weeks to 16 years and was shorter when measles had occurred over the mean age of 2.5 years. Of the cases 9% had a history of mental retardation before the onset of SSPE. The incidence of SSPE has fallen following the reduction in measles resulting from vaccination.
